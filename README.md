# Steering_Angle_Generator
These python files can be used to generate virtual steering angles for datasets acquired from a car mounter camera. For example in this way you can augment datasets used for detecting vehicles and pedestrian with steering angles so that you can train a car to simultaneously detect and drive.

**Dependancies:**

import os
import cv2
import numpy as np
import pyglet

- Export images.zip to images folder.
- You need a steering wheel game pad to generate the angles.
