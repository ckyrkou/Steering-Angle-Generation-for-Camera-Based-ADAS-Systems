# Steering Angle and Throttle Generator for Images from Self-Driving Car 
These python files can be used to generate virtual steering angles for datasets acquired from a car mounter camera. For example in this way you can augment datasets used for detecting vehicles and pedestrian with steering angles so that you can train a car to simultaneously detect and drive.

**Dependancies:**

Python Libraries: os, cv2 (OpenCV), numpy, pyglet (Interface to game controller)

- Export images.zip to images folder. This zip containes 145 images for testing. You can download a larget set from here

- You need a steering wheel game pad to generate the angles.
